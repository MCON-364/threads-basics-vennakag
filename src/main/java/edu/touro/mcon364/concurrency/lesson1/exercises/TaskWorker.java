/**
 * Exercise 2: Thread creation, naming, start(), and join()
 *
 * A TaskWorker is given a list of tasks and the name it should give
 * its background thread.  When run() is called it must:
 *
 *   1. Create a Thread that iterates over every task in the list and
 *      records how many tasks it processed.
 *   2. Give the thread the name supplied to the constructor.
 *   3. Start the thread.
 *   4. Wait (join) until the thread has fully finished before returning.
 *
 * After run() returns the caller must be able to read the result via
 * getProcessedCount() and the thread's name via getWorkerName().
 *
 * Hint: use new Thread(Runnable, String) and thread.join().
