/**
 * Exercise 4 — Submit tasks to a fixed thread pool.
 *
 * Scenario: instead of creating one {@code Thread} per task, we hand all work
 * to an {@link ExecutorService} and let it manage a fixed pool of workers.
 *
 * Your tasks:
 *
 * (A) Implement {@link #processBatch(List)}.
 *     - Create a fixed thread pool with {@link #POOL_SIZE} threads.
 *     - Submit each task name as a {@code Runnable} that:
 *         1. Increments {@code completedCount}.
 *         2. Adds the thread name to {@code workerNames} (use {@code synchronized}).
 *     - After all submissions, shut down the pool and wait for termination
 *       (up to 10 seconds).
 *
 * (B) Notice that the number of distinct thread names you see is at most
 *     {@link #POOL_SIZE}, proving that threads are reused.
