/**
 * Exercise 6 — Replace a coarse object lock with a targeted {@link ReentrantLock}.
 *
 * The class below manages two independent counters: {@code readCount} and
 * {@code writeCount}.  In the original version BOTH methods are {@code synchronized},
 * which means a {@code read()} and a {@code write()} block each other even though
 * they touch completely different state — unnecessary contention.
 *
 * Your tasks:
 *
 * (A) Remove the {@code synchronized} keyword from both methods.
 * (B) Add two separate {@link ReentrantLock} fields — one for reads, one for
 *     writes — and apply the lock/try/finally/unlock pattern in each method.
 * (C) Verify with the tests that:
 *     - Concurrent reads do NOT block each other (both run in parallel).
 *     - The counts are still correct after many concurrent calls.
 *
 * Hint: two threads can hold two different locks at the same time.
