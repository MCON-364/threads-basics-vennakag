/**
 * Exercise 5 — Returning values from concurrent tasks with {@link Callable} and
 * {@link Future}.
 *
 * Scenario: split a list of integers across several workers, have each worker
 * compute the sum of its slice, then combine the partial results into a total.
 *
 * Your tasks:
 *
 * (A) Implement {@link #parallelSum(List, int)}.
 *     - Create a fixed thread pool with {@code workers} threads.
 *     - Divide {@code numbers} into {@code workers} roughly-equal slices.
 *     - Submit each slice as a {@code Callable<Long>} that returns the sum of
 *       that slice.
 *     - Collect all {@link Future<Long>} objects BEFORE calling {@code get()} on
 *       any of them (to keep the work concurrent).
 *     - After all futures are collected, call {@code get()} on each and add
 *       partial results to a running total.
 *     - Shut down the pool and return the total.
 *
 * Note: calling {@code get()} immediately after each {@code submit()} turns
 * concurrent work back into sequential work — avoid that pattern here.
